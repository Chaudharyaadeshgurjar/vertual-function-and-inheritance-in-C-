# vertual-function-and-inheritance-in-C-
A program of using the virtual function and multipath inheritance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIRTUAL FUNCTION:-
                  A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class.
                  When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class,
                  you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function
MULTIPATH INHERITANCE:-
                       Multipath Inheritance in C++ is derivation of a class from other derived classes, which are derived from the same base class.
             
                       This type of inheritance involves other inheritance like multiple, multilevel,
               
                       hierarchical etc. Here class D is derived from class B and C.
